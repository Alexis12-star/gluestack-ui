# Universal

All `gluestack-ui` components are universal out of the box, eliminating the need for separate development for both web and mobile platforms, which is the traditional approach.

With `gluestack-ui`, developers can now craft beautiful interfaces with a single set of code that seamlessly operates across all devices, removing the need for the tedious and time-consuming process of crafting and maintaining two separate codebase for distinct platforms.

You can also use `gluestack-ui` to create styles specific to a particular platform such as Web, iOS or Android. using `$web`, `$ios` and `$android` respectively.

```jsx
import { Button, ButtonText} from '@/components/Button';

function App {
  return (
    <Button
    $web-backgroundColor="red"
    $ios-backgroundColor="blue"
    $android-backgroundColor="green"
        >
     <ButtonText>Hello World</ButtonText>
    </Button>
  )
}
```
