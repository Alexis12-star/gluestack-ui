# Introduction

**gluestack-ui** with [gluestack-style](/style/docs) offers customizable, universal, themed & styled components for your projects. Unlike traditional libraries, it's not a pre-packaged dependency. Choose the components you need and copy-paste them directly into your React, Next.js & React Native projects.

### Why use gluestack-ui with gluestack-style?

- Not a Library: Avoid unnecessary bloat by selecting only the components you need.

- Easy Integration: Copy and paste component code snippets into your project files.

- Full Customization: Tailor components to fit your project's needs by adjusting styles and behaviors.

>Note: This is not a component library as you cannot import components inside your application, to directly import components inside your application you can directly use [@gluestack-ui/themed](/ui/docs).
