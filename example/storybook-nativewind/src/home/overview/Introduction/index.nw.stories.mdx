# Introduction

**gluestack-ui** with [NativeWind](https://www.nativewind.dev/) offers customizable, styled components for your projects. Unlike traditional libraries, it's not a pre-packaged dependency. Choose the components you need and copy-paste them directly into your React, Next.js & React Native projects.

### Why use gluestack-ui with NativeWind?

- Not a Library: Avoid unnecessary bloat by selecting only the components you need.

- Easy Integration: Copy and paste component code snippets into your project files.

- Full Customization: Tailor components to fit your project's needs by adjusting styles and behaviors.

>Note: This pattern uses [NativeWind](https://www.nativewind.dev/v4/overview) version 4.0.36. For styling guidelines, please refer to NativeWind [documentation](https://www.nativewind.dev/v4/overview).
